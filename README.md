It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Scikit-learn is arguably the most popular Python library for Machine Learning today. Thousands of Data Scientists and Machine Learning practitioners use it for day to day tasks throughout a Machine Learning project’s life cycle. Due to its popularity and coverage of a wide variety of ML models and built-in utilities, jobs for Scikit-learn are in high demand, both in industry and academia.
If you’re an aspiring machine learning engineer ready to take real-world projects head-on, Hands-on Scikit-Learn for Machine Learning will walk you through the most commonly used models, libraries, and utilities offered by Scikit-learn.
By the end of the course, you will have a set of ML problem-solving tools in the form of code modules and utility functions based on Scikit-learn in one place, instead of spread over several books and courses, which you can easily use on real-world projects and data sets.
